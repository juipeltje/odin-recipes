    <h1>Tavern pizza</h1>

    <h3>Description</h3>

    <p>Tavern pizza, the original Chicago-style pie, has a super thin, crispy crust with almost
       no rise. The toppings used here are a great combo of spicy and sweet. The pickled pepperoncini add a nice
       acidic balance to the pepperoni and cheese. Customize to your liking. Using a rolling pin to fully flatten
       the edges of the crust is different from how you would normally shape a pizza crust but this helps keep it thin.
       Add red chile flakes and Parmesan to finish.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    
    <h4>Dough:</h4>
    
    <ul>
      <li>1.25 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon granulated sugar</li>
      <li>0.75 teaspoon instant yeast</li>
      <li>0.5 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
      <li>0.25 cup plus 3 tablespoons cold water</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for greasing</li>
      <li>cornmeal, for dusting</li>    
    </ul>

    <h4>Toppings:</h4>

    <ul>
      <li>0.5 cup marinara sauce, divided (such as Rao's)</li>
      <li>1 cup shredded low-moisture mozzarella cheese</li>
      <li>0.25 cup drained and sliced pepperoncini salad peppers, or to taste</li>
      <li>12 slices pepperoni, or to taste</li>
      <li>0.5 jalapeno pepper, seeded and thinly sliced</li>
      <li>hot honey, for drizzling</li>
      <li>coarsely chopped fresh basil</li>    
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <ol>
      <li>Combine flour, sugar, yeast, and salt in a food processor and process until combined, about 3 seconds. With processor running, slowly pour cold water and oil through the food chute and process until dough forms a sticky ball that clears the sides of the bowl, 45 seconds to 1 minute</li>
      <li>Lightly oil a work surface and set dough ball on top; knead until smooth, about 1 minute. Shape dough into a tight ball and place in a large bowl greased with oil. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and allow dough to rise at room temperature until almost doubled in size, 1 hour 30 minutes to 2 hours.</li>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 500 degrees F (260 degrees C). Place a pizza stone on the lowest rack in the oven.</li>
      <li>Transfer dough to a lightly floured work surface and gently re-shape into a ball. Coat dough ball lightly with flour and flatten into an 8-inch disk using your fingertips. Using a rolling pin, roll dough into a 12-inch circle, dusting dough lightly with flour as needed.</li>
      <li>Dust a pizza peel with cornmeal and transfer dough circle on top. Spread marinara sauce on dough, leaving a 0.5-inch border around the edge. Top evenly with mozzarella, pepperoncini, pepperoni slices, and sliced jalapeno.</li>
      <li>Carefully transfer pizza onto pizza stone in the preheated oven and bake until edges are golden brown and cheese is melted, about 10 minutes.</li>
      <li>Remove from oven; drizzle with hot honey and sprinkle with basil.</li>
    </ol>
